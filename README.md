# minishell
## Description
Minishell is a minimalist UNIX shell written in C that replicates core bash features and 
provides an in-depth exploration of UNIX process management, pipes, signals, file descriptors, and parsing logic

## ✅ Key requirements
- Display a prompt when waiting for a new command.
- Have a working history.
- Search and launch the right executable.
- Use at most one global variable to indicate a received signal.

## 🚀 Features 
- Tokenization and parsing of input to handle quotes, pipes, and redirections.
- Execute commands with PATH, relative, and absolute paths
- Command history via 'readline'
- Handle quotes: ' (literal), " (allows variable expansion)
- Expand environment variables ($VAR, $?)
- Support redirections: <, >, >>, << (heredoc)
- Support pipes (|)
- Built-in commands: echo -n, cd, pwd, export, unset, env, exit
- Signal handling for Ctrl+C, Ctrl+D, and Ctrl+\ like Bash

## 🧱 Input Processing Flow
1. **Lexing** – Takes the full command line and splits it into logical units called tokens. For example, the input "echo "hello world" | wc -w" becomes a token list like [echo], [hello world], [|], [wc], [-w]. This lexer handles quotes and separates words based on spaces and operators.

2. **Parser** – After the lexer, the parser organizes the token list into a hierarchical structure called an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). This tree represents the logical structure of the command line, respecting the precedence of operators (|, &&, ||, ;). This allows us to understand which commands to run and in what order. For instance, in a command with pipes, the tree will have a | operator node with a command on its left and another on its right.

3. **Prexecution** - In this phase, the AST is prepared for execution. Environment variables (like $PATH or $HOME) are expanded, I/O redirections and heredocs are managed, and absolute paths for commands are resolved.

3.1. _Expansion_ – Environment variables (`$VAR`, `$?`) are expanded, respecting shell quoting rules:
   - `'single quotes'` prevent expansion.
   - `"double quotes"` allow expansion.
4. **Execution** – traverses the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) node by node. For each node, it takes the corresponding action:
- Executes external commands single and in pipes.
- If it is operator node, it manages the execution flow. For example, for a pipe (|), it creates left and right child processes and handles communication between them.
- Built-in commands are executed and is tracked their state and if they are a child process if they are part of a pipe. **Expected behavior:**

   - **echo** – Print the given arguments to standard output, separated by spaces, optionally suppressing the trailing newline with **-n**.
   - **env** – Display the list of environment variables.
   - **pwd** – Print the current working directory.
   - **export** – List or set environment variables in the shell.
   - **exit** – Terminate the shell with the given or last exit status.

This modular flow ensures predictable behavior and makes debugging easier.

## 💡 Usage

Supported operations include piping, redirections, environment management, and built-in command execution.
